# bar-service-analysis
This project was for a predictive analytics class during undergrad, in which my team served as consultants for a large entertainment venue looking to improve their bar throughput and revenues.

For this project, we reviewed video footage of their bar during an active time to log data of how long transactions were taking, what drinks were being ordered, and what station of the bar the transactions were happening at.

The attached .ipynb file is the exploration of the dataset we created, and the attached presentation is a summation of our works through Tableau and R to visualize our findings and show the results of our modeling to predict a transaction time.

With our findings, the organization was able to take our suggestions to increase bar throughput with a $2MM investment in restructuring the layout and processes used for serving customers.
